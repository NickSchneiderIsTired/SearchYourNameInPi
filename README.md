# SearchYourNameInPi
This program lets you search your name (translated to a number) in around 700 million digits of pi.
It takes your name and calculates it into a number with the 26-letter-system. It takes the digits of the number and looks for them in pi.

In order to run the code in an IDE, you need to make a bigger heap-space (around 6GB) cuz the program loads Pi into your RAM.
You will also need to download the .txt with the digits from mediafire because i couldn't upload it to GitHub.
